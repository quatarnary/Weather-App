# In order to take a build
* You need an API key from https://www.weatherapi.com/
* You need to have a local.plist file in the Properties folder
* in the local.plist you need to have [WEATHER_API_KEY] key and for the value you need to insert your API key

## Favorite location implementation
* In the debug mode app provides few "favorite" locations for you
* I didn't implement addition of the favorite locations (yet, I'm hopeful that I will)
